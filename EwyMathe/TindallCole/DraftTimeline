Project: Looking at Data
Timeline:
  Weeks 1-2: use Breast Cancer data from IntLIM to learn how to load and analyze data in R
  Weeks 3-6: collect and organize publicly available data to asses consistency across metabolomic profiles in different model systems
  Weeks 6-8: work on cleaning and analyzing data
* This is a smaller time line than expected and may take longer to collect and analyze large amounts of publicly available data.
