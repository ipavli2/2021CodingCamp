I don't have much experience in coding so I haven't figured out the specifics yet, but generally I want to make a code that can take a given DNA sequence, separate the sequence into genes, and then make predictions about each gene in the sequence.
Want to be able to process files that store DNA sequences, convert the sequence to numerical values so they can be used to train learning models, and train a machine learning model to make predictions about any given DNA sequence.
